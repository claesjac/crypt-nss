    - LWPCompat now overrides configure so http_configure in Net::HTTP::Methods gets called correctly.
    - LWPCompat now also sets $Net::HTTPS::SSL_SOCKET_CLASS for you on import.
    - Net::NSS::SSL now has a $DefaultURL global that can be set to override default behavior of setting
      verification URL to what PeerHost says.
