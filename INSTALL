This modules requires NSS (Netscape Security Services) which is available for download from ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/security/nss/releases/

Development and testing has been done against the 3.12 release with the bundled NSPR 4.7

Currently we require that that the headers, libraries and binaries are installed in the directories "include", "lib" and "bin" with a common parent directory. Before running Makefile.PL set the environment variable NSS_BASE to the path to this directory.

If your libs aren't installed in a path where ld can normally find them you might have to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH (or DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH) or similar before running.
