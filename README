NAME
    Crypt::NSS - Perl bindings to NSS (Netscape Security Services)

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides an interface to Netscape Security Services (NSS)
    which is a set of libraries that Firefox, Thunderbird and several other
    applications uses for crypto, secure sockets, signing mail etc. NSS
    provides support for SSL v2 and v3, TLS, PKCS #5, PKCS #7, PKCS #11,
    PKCS #12, S/MIME, X.509 v3 certificates, and other security standards.

    Currently this module only implements the SSL bits but in the future
    (patches welcome!!) most of NSS will be available via this module.

INTERFACE
  MODULE IMPORT

    During import no initalization is normally done. It's however possible
    to do this by passing either `config_dir => PATH' or `init'. If the
    later, import checks for the environment `NSS_CONFIG_DIR' and sets the
    config dir to that if set.

  CLASS METHODS

    config_dir ( ) : string
        Returns the path where to look for `cert8.db', `key3.db' and
        `secmod.db' databases upon initialization.

    set_config_dir ( $directory : string ) : boolean
        Specify the path to the directory where the `cert8.db', `key3.db'
        and `secmod.db' databases can be found. It's only allowed to set the
        directory prior to initialization or this method with return a false
        value.

    is_initialized ( ) : boolean
        Returns whether the underlying NSS library has been initialized or
        not.

    initialize ( ) : integer
        Initializes NSS. Returns 0 on success or an error code on failure.
        Initialization is usually done when importing this module by passing
        either `config_dir => $path' or `init' to use the default config
        directory (`.').

    shutdown ( )
        Closes the certificate and key databases.
